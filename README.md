# myflatironp5-project

This project is intended to solve the problem of long term parking of ones car/cars in a public parking garage
and be able to use an app to see all cars you parked in the garage, and details about each car. 

An owner of a car/cars looking to park them in safe public parking garage can sign up in the app,
using their personal information like: name, email, phone, and password to create an account.
Once this accoutn is created they are then presented with a form in which they enter the make-model,
color and number plate of each car. An owner/user can then login to the the app to view their parked cars,
edit information about them, add more cars, and also be able to see their parked cars.

There are also routes to make updates or delete a car from the database.

This enables users to submit information about a car they want to park in the garage
2. User's cars tab:
This gives users an interactive view of all their parked cars with detailed information
